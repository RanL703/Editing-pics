# Editing-pics
Here we will make use of the Pillow, Python Imaging Library to edit some flower pics of my own garden.
Steps:
1. First install Pillow if its not yet installed using: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/basic-installation.html
2. Then we will import the modules we need to use from the PIL library.
3. After that we will import the os module.
4. We will define the variables path and pathOut as string of folder paths of both the input and output folders.
5. Then we will define a for loop which will access all files in the folder defined within path variable.
6. Then we open each image using the Image library into the img variable.
7. We add our edits using the [library](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) here.
8. Then we clean out the name and let the next image in line come for some whitewashing.
